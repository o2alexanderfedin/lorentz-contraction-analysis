## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Lorentz contraction in special relativity, challenging the standard interpretation through rigorous kinematic analysis and interactive visualizations.

## Contents

### üìÑ LaTeX Document
- `lorentz_contraction_fedin.tex` - Main theoretical paper
- `lorentz_contraction_fedin.pdf` - Compiled PDF version

**Abstract:** The paper demonstrates that when initial conditions and measurement procedures are rigorously defined within a single inertial frame, no contraction is observed. The Lorentz contraction emerges only when coordinates are transformed between frames using relativity of simultaneity.

### üéØ Interactive Visualizations

#### 1. Relativistic Particle Motion (`relativistic_particle_motion.html`)
- Tracks point object P‚ÇÄ through acceleration and uniform motion
- Shows three key time points (T‚ÇÄ, T‚ÇÅ, T‚ÇÇ) and positions (X‚ÇÄ, X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ)
- Displays real-time Lorentz factor calculations
- Default velocity V‚ÇÅ = c/2 (50% speed of light)
- Three synchronized graphs:
  - Position vs Time
  - Velocity vs Time  
  - Distance from X‚ÇÄ vs Time

#### 2. Laser Interferometer (`laser_interferometer.html`)
- Demonstrates perpendicular beam detection system
- Shows how simultaneous measurements are made in observer's frame
- Interactive controls for object length, velocity, and mirror positions
- Visualizes the measurement process with animations

#### 3. Simultaneity Detector (`simultaneity_detector.html`)
- Illustrates how simultaneity is frame-dependent
- Interactive demonstration of Einstein's train thought experiment
- Shows light signal propagation from events to central detector
- Adjustable parameters for event timing and observer velocity

#### 4. Point Particle Motion (`point_particle_motion.html`)
- Non-relativistic version for comparison
- Clear visualization of acceleration and uniform motion phases
- Helpful for understanding the basic kinematics before relativistic effects

## Key Physics Concepts

### Motion Profile
1. **Phase 1 (T‚ÇÄ to T‚ÇÅ):** Constant acceleration G
   - Position: x(t) = X‚ÇÄ + ¬ΩG(t-T‚ÇÄ)¬≤
   - Velocity: v(t) = G(t-T‚ÇÄ)

2. **Phase 2 (T‚ÇÅ to T‚ÇÇ):** Uniform motion at V‚ÇÅ
   - Position: x(t) = X‚ÇÅ + V‚ÇÅ(t-T‚ÇÅ)
   - Velocity: v = V‚ÇÅ = G(T‚ÇÅ-T‚ÇÄ)

3. **Phase 3 (t > T‚ÇÇ):** Continuing uniform motion
   - Position: x(t) = X‚ÇÇ + V‚ÇÅ(t-T‚ÇÇ)

### Relativistic Effects at V‚ÇÅ = c/2
- Lorentz factor: Œ≥ = 1.155
- Time dilation: 15.5%
- Length contraction: 13.4%
